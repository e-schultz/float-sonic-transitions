<img width="1008" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-15 at 8 14 57 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9991bf4b-f3fe-4857-919e-ac3f35705c0f" />


An interactive microsite exploring the parallels between personal/professional development processes and Richie Hawtin's DE9: Transitions methodology.

## Project Overview

This microsite demonstrates how life and career transitions mirror the artistic process behind DE9: Transitions - taking existing elements, deconstructing them, building new patterns, and creating seamless transitions between states.

**Live Preview**: https://lov-float-dispatch-manifesto-forge.lovable.app/

## Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: Four expandable stages mapping personal process to DE9 methodology
- **Animated Waveforms**: Canvas-based audio visualization representing continuous transitions
- **Sigil Navigation**: Symbol-based navigation system with smooth scrolling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Dark theme with cyan/magenta/yellow accent colors

## Process Mapping

### 1. Deconstruction Phase `{∇}`
- Career transitions and pattern extraction
- Breaking down complex opportunities into components
- Learning from diverse experiences

### 2. Loop Palette Creation `{Ξ}`
- FLOAT methodology development
- Skill accumulation and knowledge crystallization
- Building ritual infrastructure and systems

### 3. Real-time Composition `{∷}`
- Dynamic adaptation and live creation
- Continuous integration of new experiences
- Professional grace under pressure

### 4. Seamless Transitions `{◊}`
- Maintaining continuity through change
- Relationship integrity across outcomes
- Evolution without losing core identity

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Canvas API** for waveform animations
- **Intersection Observer** for scroll interactions
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layouts

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Design Philosophy

This project embodies the FLOAT methodology - creating systems that support continuous transition and evolution while maintaining essential continuity. The interface itself demonstrates the principles it describes.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by Richie Hawtin's DE9: Transitions (2005) and the broader philosophy of using technology to create seamless experiences that support human transition and growth.
